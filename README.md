# miXer:a Machine-learning method to detect genomic Imbalances exploiting X-chromosome Exome Reads

miXer (with a capital X) is a lightweight machine learning tool designed to detect genomic deletions and duplications by exploiting the natural difference in X-chromosome copy number between male and female exomes. It builds on EXCAVATOR2 for data preprocessing and combines two key components: a single-exon Copy Number (CN) classifier based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), trained on data from six widely used exome sequencing kits; and a post-classification step that uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for filtering and aggregation.

# Setup
To run miXer, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) must be available. Optionally, an [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) image can be used to run the tool, which can be built using the previously obtained Docker image.
## Installation

Clone the repository:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/ctglab/miXer`

### Building the Docker image

To run miXer, a Docker image must be built using the cloned repository. Assuming to be in the recently cloned "miXer" folder, run the following:<br>
`docker build -t mixer_docker:latest .`

### Building the Apptainer image

Using the previously built image:<br>
- **Step 1**: Saving the Docker image as `.tar` file: `docker save mixer_docker:latest -o /path/to/mixer_docker.tar`<br>
- **Step 2**: Build the Apptainer image `.sif` file: `apptainer build mixer_apptainer.sif docker-archive://path/to/mixer_docker.tar`

# Running miXer: Requirements and Configuration Steps

## Control Sample Requirements:

- **Required control sample pool size**: **10** samples.  
  **ALL F** samples are required for CNV calling on X chromosome.  
  **WARNING**: Unpredictable behaviour can arise if using a different number of control samples.

- **If reusing control data from a previous EXCAVATOR2/miXer run**:  
  The `.RData` file generated by EXCAVATOR2's DataPrepare module can be reused.

- **If control samples are unavailable**:  
  miXer can exploit the control sample `.RData` generated when building the X-chromosome training set  
  of the SVM CN classifier. Such files are available in (...)  
  **WARNING**: This will only be feasible if the exome sequencing kit is **exactly the same** as one of those reported below (unpredictable behaviour otherwise):

    | Kit name               | Capture Technology                                                     | Bait Size (Mb) | Ref. Build | Platform                  | Read Length   |

## Location of Sample BAM Files to Analyze
miXer requires **all** sample `.bam` file to be located in the same folder.

## miXer Configuration - Resources folder
miXer expects the following files grouped inside a single folder:
- **Sample list file**: `.tsv` file file containing details on the samples which will be analyzed.
- **Target file**: `.bed` file containing all target regions captured by the enrichment kit used for the cohort in analysis.
- **OPTIONAL: RData file of pre-made Control Sample Groups**: `.RData` file containing the averaged read counts of control samples previously obtained through EXCAVATOR2.

### Sample list file structure

| ID     | bamName          | Gender | sampleType |
|--------|------------------|--------|------------|
| test1  | sample_file.bam  | M      | T          |
| ctrl1  | control1_file.bam| F      | C          |

Where:
- **ID**: Sample identifier which will be used to name miXer outputs. **MUST** not be an integer--only value.
- **bamName**: Filename of `.bam` file for current sample, must not contain the full path to the file — only the filename.
- **Gender**: Specify if sample is known **M**/**F** (if unknown, please write **F** — miXer will correct it automatically).
- **sampleType**: Either **T** (Test) or **C** (Control); CNV calling will be done for **T** samples using **C** samples as controls.

## miXer Configuration - Support files
Two sets of support files are required: one for EXCAVATOR2 and one for miXer.

#### EXCAVATOR2-specific support
- **CentromerePosition_hgVersion.txt**: Containing the coordinates of the centromeres for the considered human genome assembly.
- **ChromosomeCoordinate_hgVersion.txt**: Containing the coordinates of chromosomes.
- **Gap_hgVersion.txt**: Containing gap annotations.
- **mappability_track_hgVersion.bw**: Required in order to annotate each target region with their average mappability.

#### miXer-specific support
- **GRC_pseudoautosomal_regions_hgVersion.gz**: Annotation track contraining PAR regions

miXer expects the following files to be located together in a single directory.

## miXer Configuration - EXCAVATOR2 Singularity file
At the moment, to run miXer, the `.sif` file of EXCAVATOR2 is required. Instructions on how to obtain it are to be found [in EXCAVATOR2 repository.](https://github.com/ctglab/excavator2)

A JSON configuration file template can be found in `utils/` folder.

# Running miXer: Docker Image
Once the JSON configuration file is complete, miXer can then be run using the provided `run_docker_preprocessing_and_inference.sh` bash script:
```bash
./path/to/utils/docker_utils/simplified_pipeline/run_docker_preprocessing_and_inference.sh <config.json> [DOCKER_IMAGE]
```
Where:
- `<config.json>`: Path to the JSON configuration file (required).
- `[DOCKER_IMAGE]`: Docker image `name:tag` to use (optional). 
  - Defaults to `mixer_docker:latest` if omitted.
- To use a custom image, pass it as the second argument:

# Running miXer: Apptainer Image
When running miXer with the Apptainer image, use the provided `run_apptainer_preprocessing_and_inference.sh` script:

```bash
./path/to/utils/apptainer_utils/run_apptainer_preprocessing_and_inference.sh <config.json> <apptainer_image.sif>
```

- `<config.json>`: compiled miXer JSON configuration (same schema as Docker).
- `<apptainer_image.sif>`: Apptainer image file.

# miXer Outputs

miXer will output three folders, which  will be stored in the previously specified `main_outdir_host` directory:

- **exca2_output_experiment_name**: Folder containing the full output of EXCAVATOR2 tool:
  - If control samples are provided, EXCAVATOR2 CNV calls will also be available. Otherwise, if miXer is run using a pre-made control sample RData, only the output of the DataPrepare module will be present.
- **mixer_vcfs**: Folder containing VCFs (v.4.4) for all samples specified as `T` in the `sampleList.tsv`
- **mixer_windows**: Folder containing, for all samples specified as `T` in the `sampleList.tsv`:
  - **SVM_guess_ploidy_results.txt**: File containing miXer's estimated ploidy status of the X-chromosome for each sample
  - **sampleID_TARGET folders**: One folder for each sample, containing:
    - **sampleID_TARGET_hmm_bw20_PASS_ONLY_windows.bed**: PASS quality CNV windows only (i.e. CNVs with a confidence score higher than 0.9)
    - **test1_TARGET_hmm_bw20_windows.bed**: ALL CNV windows defined by miXer.

## miXer CNV windows

Files **sampleID_TARGET_hmm_bw20_PASS_ONLY_windows.bed** and **test1_TARGET_hmm_bw20_windows.bed** will contain CNV windows defined by miXer in `.bed` format with the following structure:<br>
